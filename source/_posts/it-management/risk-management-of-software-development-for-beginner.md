## Risk management process

1.  Risk identification
2.  Risk assessment
3.  Risk reduction process design and implementation.

## Risk Identification

You should hold a **meeting** to find out the risks.

* Timing of meeting: After clarify the main software goals.

* People in meeting:

  * Project manager(PM)
  * Technical(software engineer and System analyst(SA))
  * business(law party or business party)

* Good risk identification meeting should:

  * No judgement-Every discovery is important(even the probability of risk is extremely low)
  * Focus-Don't need to think about the risk reduction process in this process.
  * Welcome bad news-award every finding in meeting.

* Good conventional expressions:

  * It is a good question.
  * It is a good concern.

## Risk assessment

When you have a list of risk.SA and PM should sort and characteristic the risk.

1.  Type

* Functional related
* Engineering related
* Business related

2.  Potential damage

* What will happen
* How it cause the damage to the project(software goals)

3.  Probability

* Probability
* Measurement tool
* What sign/identifier we can see when it happen

## Risk reduction process design and implementation.

* **Reduction**

  1.  Sample target: Software deployment
  2.  Process: Soft-launch - Avoid marketing cost for a software that have no thorough test.

* **Retention**

  1.  Sample target: Critical system component
  2.  Process: Develop the critical system component by internal development team and increase it priority in schedule.

* **Sharing(transfer)**

  1.  Sample target: Server availability
  2.  Process: Put it on cloud(AWS)

* **Avoidance**

  1.  Sample target: Non critical system component
  2.  Process: Delay development or low priority of non Critical component&feature
