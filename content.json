Bad Result Listed below result in future related model and view don’t know the state changed but they need to because the controller by-passed(causing a bug)(Not OCP) hard to debug,the controller no

Ordering Service.E.g Food ordering. Queue(Real Time Ticketing).E.g Queuing in restaurant. POS System.E.g Payment for watching a movie. What you can learn after reading this article? Help you evaluate the need of kiosk service of your company Help you pick the correct kiosk service provider Detail staff you need to know about how to manage kiosk service How much time you will use for reading this article? 30 minutes Real life situationJeff is a it manager of a big real estate company of Hong Kong. The real estate company has many shopping mall and the customer always has new need to fulfill. He collects the requirement and wonder that whether those requirement can be satisfied by kiosk service. Evaluate the need of kiosk service Need Your client will never not tell you to need the kiosk-service to satisfied their need.It is up to IT-manager to discover it Requirement and factFirst of all you need to collect requirement and facts. In Jeff case,he knows that Requirements: Client always want to which stores sell product they want and their locations. They don’t want to walk and see every store to find what they are selling. Facts: Client speak different language.Some of them speak Mandarin,some of them speak Cantonese and some of them speak English. Client are normal young(around 25-55).They knows technology really much and own a smart phone. Analysis the requirementFor 1. Requirement,it can be a kiosk or staff from customer center to answer the client question. However,Jeff choose kiosk because Hiring staff that speak Mandarin,Cantonese and English are too expensive.However kiosk can display multi-language digital information. The Kiosk can display the image and the map of the store.However staff can only tell them by words. Now Jeff want kiosk which displayed the stores of the shopping mall.But what he needs to know before he pick his kiosk-service-provider? How to pick kiosk service providerDo a research about the famous local kiosk service providerYou should make a list comparing the local kiosk service provider include but not limited the following. Whether their software are written by themselves.It is very important because it means whether they can fulfill some custom requirement for your company. Whether they provide 24-hour support?It will be very troublesome when the kiosk is down but no one can fix it. Price model. Security architecture. See what your competitor pickYour competitor can be a good reference to your choice. You should use their kiosk and find the strength and limitations.And ask whether your service provider solves those limitations. Find similar software of kioskThey are many software on capterra. You should find similar software of kiosk and investigate it so that you can make useful and necessary requirement to your kiosk service provider Detail staff you need to know about how to manage kiosk service Operating system of Kiosk The OS of kiosk is mainly android and windows.The window is developed by c#(.NET) and android mainly java.You should have software engineer that have related skill to identify the threats of kiosk. Tell people you have kiosk service We always see not many people use the kiosk because people normally don’t know you have a kiosk. You should tell user your have new kiosk and attract user to use the kiosk by marketing campaign(like 10% discount). Cooperate the kiosk and front-line employee We always see the front-line employee thinks about the kiosk is their enemy so they don’t really suggest customer to use it but it is not necessary to be that way. You should make them thing kiosk is just another tool to them.They should make good use of it. FinalJeff finally get kiosk for his shopping mall.The new kiosk satisfy all his requirement and the customer traffic increase significantly.So what do you think about this article?Share it if you like or reply me about your thoughts. do you think about this article?Share it if you like or reply me about your thoughts.","categories":[{"name":"管理和协作","slug":"管理和协作","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/categories/管理和协作/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to manage offshore development successfully.","slug":"it-management/how-to-run-a-successful-offshore-development","date":"2018-04-28T08:09:02.000Z","updated":"2018-04-28T12:40:44.321Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/28/it-management/how-to-run-a-successful-offshore-development.html","link":"","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/2018/04/28/it-management/how-to-run-a-successful-offshore-development.html","excerpt":"","text":"Before ReadingAlthough we knows the adv the offshore development,but we also know the production rate can be lower significantly if the offshore development goes wrong,so you gonna learn how to manage offshore development after reading this article. What you can learn after reading this article? Help you determine whether you need offshore development center/worker You will know how to manage a offshore development center for you company How much time you will use for reading this article?30 minutes Real life situationJeff is a technical manager of a Hong Kong IT company.He has too many project to work on recently and he wonder whether some of them can be developed by offshore employees. Things you need to think about before making a project to be developed by offshore team.DecisionOverhead of offshore development for every project exists,all you need to do is find those low overhead project and reduce the overhead as much as possible The low overhead project has some properties. A open scheduleIf the project schedule is very tight,you need to check the status of every task in every day which make the communication cost is very high. Challenging projectIf the project is very technically challenging which requires engineers to communicate and exchange opinions frequently.The engineers usually not tend to communicate when the communicate cost is high which will cost communication failure. Long term projectBecause the project usually involves knowledge transfer between old and new engineer frequently so it is very important that they have low communication cost. International projectIf the project is very specific for local user,you may need many time to correct some problem that caused by cultural difference. So the Jeff select the a international travel spot website(which is less local and less urgent) and app to be developed by the offshore team.But what can he do next to reduce the overhead and manage this project successfully? Requirement and schedule by pivotal trackerPivotal tracker is a agile development tools.Adv: Every one in the team(local and remote) know who is responsible for specific task and the state of different task at any time. Bug tracking. You can also set a release so that everyone knows whether a release is accepted. Efficient cost analysis and development speed analysis tool. Sample of pivotal tracker on Testing document on test lodgeTest lodge is a testing management tools which has a good integration with pivotal tracker.For the requirement that is complicated,it is good to record them in a test case so that the offshore developer can run through the test case before you check it which can reduce many communication cost. Deployment on hockey appHockey app is a internal deployment tool which allows you to deploy ios and android app to every one in you team.Adv: Multiple version coexistence Email notification after deployed Easy integration(6 hours) Regular meeting on every weekI have suggest very good tools(all of them are very cheap and have a free trial version) but I believe that must be some problems that is not included so that I suggest a regular meeting per week for communication for the team communicate special issue. Project is doneThe international travel spot website and app has been developed successfully.His boss is very happy about the cost reduction and the product.And hopefully Jeff get promoted quickly XD.","categories":[{"name":"管理和协作","slug":"管理和协作","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/categories/管理和协作/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to negotiate with your boss to get a nice computer for your work","slug":"it-management/how-to-negotiate-with-your-boss-to-get-a-nice-computer","date":"2018-04-28T08:09:02.000Z","updated":"2018-04-28T12:40:44.321Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/28/it-management/how-to-negotiate-with-your-boss-to-get-a-nice-computer.html","link":"","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/2018/04/28/it-management/how-to-negotiate-with-your-boss-to-get-a-nice-computer.html","excerpt":"","text":"Before ReadingAs a software engineer we all knows a good computer or tool can massively improve our productivity,but our manager usually don’t understand this.They may think you can work with any device but they don’t know how much time and effort will be wasted when your computer is not good enough. What you can learn after reading this article? You will know should you start a negotiation with your boss about your computer. You will know how to negotiate with your boss to get a nice computer for your work. How much time you will use for reading this article?30 minutes Should you start a negotiation with your boss about your computer?DecisionBased on the programming task to decide negotiation or not 1.For high end graphics programming or CAD workYou should negotiate with your boss about to get best computer. 2.For standard business software programmingFor example,you write it using android studio,eclipse and visual studio.You should negotiate with your boss to get mid-range computer. Mid range machine should have:CPU:2 cores min, 4 cores good anymore at this stage is overkill.Memory:8GB is min and anymore is nice to have.Hardisk:SSD(128GB) is min and anymore is nice to have.Monitor:2 x 19 monitors is a minimum. 3.No programmer should use low end machines. Now you have decide you need to negotiate with your manager,but how to do it? Timing of start a negotiationTimingPick a timing that your manager need to decide quickly You should raise your requirement before a project start or in your first work day.Because your manager have a bigger time-constraint in that moment. You should make it clear you won’t start your work or you productivity will be very low until you have proper device by email. Please remind that your attitude should be nice and you do this for the good of your manager and the company. Define your bargaining rangeOptionAlways prepare enough option for bargaining You should at least have two computer configuration( max to min )( keep it secret! ) that can help you to get the job done.You should works for the max computer configuration but it is okay to accept any deals that above min computer configuration.If your manager provide any option that is lower the min computer configuration.Just told them that is below your minimal expectation and walk away.Don’t make it personal. supply and demand picture Convince your manager that many company are providing good computer to programmerDemand and supplyLet’s your manager know the demand and supply of good computer It is hard to convince your manager why they should do this by data.Because they are not expert on this thing,they normally just follow what other manager does.You need to state many company doing so because 1.It is part of the Joel Test(a well known test for determining how attractive as company are to programmer).2.It is proven by expert Jeff Atwood. If your company fails to do so,the company has little chance to succeed due to lack of programmer.Because programmer will generally work for company providing those thing. Give the motivation to your managerMotivateMotivate your manager in their point of view Manager mainly focus on outcome.It means you need to explain what you can improve on your outcome if there is a better computer.For example,1.The schedule can be shorten by 20%.Because the compilation time is shorten by xx%.2.The programmer will looks more concentrated to their job.Because they has much less possibility switch to youtube for killing time during wait for the compilation,automatic test execution and program deployment.3.There will be less turnover rate because programmer are much happier with good tool.","categories":[{"name":"管理和协作","slug":"管理和协作","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/categories/管理和协作/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"More than requirement-Discover the real question(Lession learn from develop the digital pathology program for largest third-party medical laboratory group in china)","slug":"it-management/more-than-requirement-discover-the-real-question-lesson-from-develop-the-digital-pathology-program","date":"2018-04-28T08:09:02.000Z","updated":"2018-04-28T08:52:49.547Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/28/it-management/more-than-requirement-discover-the-real-question-lesson-from-develop-the-digital-pathology-program.html","link":"","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/2018/04/28/it-management/more-than-requirement-discover-the-real-question-lesson-from-develop-the-digital-pathology-program.html","excerpt":"","text":"Before Reading What you can learn after reading this article?

We do small upfront design(in uml or another draft tool) and do some implementation to get some feedback to our design.The whole process is iterative until we get good feasible program design for this iteration process.

What is critical thinking what is the advantage&amp;disadvantage of it Implementation in real life(discussion with my colleague about REST-API, proper HTTP status code for invalid DELETE) How much time you will use for reading this article? 25 minutes What is Critical ThinkingCritical thinking is a skill that we use to find the fact or make decision in the best we can(Or based on information we known). Ability layer The ability to ask right related and critical question Ask Question systematically(In a efficient order) Ask question actively. Altitude layer Keep the conversation going to allow more question in order to get more information(so be polite instead of being rude) Evidence first Judge everything.Instead of having your opinion and conclusion first and then find evidence(We are not politician,we are Software Engineer ). What is the advantage&amp;disadvantage of itAdvantage Allow you to use your best to find the fact or make decision. Allow you see and review the structure and content of your argument. Disadvantage Energy and time consuming. Take time to train It use your best ability only. StrategyIn a new area we don’t know much we absorb knowledge and decision like spongy to absorb basic knowledge.When thing become critical and in a hard area.We utilize our critical thinking skill Implementation in real life(discussion with my colleague about REST-API)BackgroundTester said that my program have a bug that handle delete a resource incorrectly.It show forbidden but the user is the creator of that resource. I check and realize the program allow user to delete a resource that is not existed anymore(a cached problem).I think is this a server respond bug that I think it should return 404 instead 403(Not authorized).Then I communicate with backend developer(We named he Miller).He confirmed that it do return 403 but it is the case he never think about before.And we have a further discussion about that,and the discussion like that. ConversationMiller:I think it has some point to return 403,if it return 404,it hints a hacker or unauthorized user know that resource existed and deleted,that is a information leak(Evidence).Me:I see,it surely is a good point that I never think before.Is it our application need so high security that leaking a information about resource existed and deleted that make us sacrifice the Discoverability and Maintainability of the program.Let me think and research. Critical thinking(Content and Architecture)What is our question/topic?Proper HTTP status code for invalid DELETE(When resource not existed) in Restful api when leaking a information about resource existed and deleted is not the critical failure of the program. Category of topicIt is a prescriptive topic instead of descriptive topic when it come to program design decision.Our preference in this topic are Security Discoverability Maintainability SupportingEvidence 404 do allow people to realize the resource not existed anymore. 404 do expose a information that resource existed and deleted. 403 said request is valid but the user don’t have the permission.(it basically said resource existed but you don’t have the right to do so ) 401 said the user is not simply unauthorized and not mention whether the existence of resource. ConclusionFor proper HTTP status code for invalid DELETE(When resource not existed) 404 is good when information about resource existed and deleted is not the critical failure of the program.401 is good when information about resource existed and deleted is the critical failure of the program.403 is misleading when information about resource existed and deleted is not the critical failure of the program.

Always has a fallback plan.If deployment on one cloud platform don’t work well,go to another platform or even traditional deployment. Frequent deployment.The first deployment should be within first week development to evaluate whether the cloud platform is suitable for the web application. Make a good balance of development cost and maintenance cost.A low maintenance cloud platform that require high development cost is not worth it. ##Basic suggestion for software engineer for cloud platform Understand it is necessary to express out your concern and your problem so that the manager can understand the cost.

Determine whether you should use jsonp Understand what is JSONP Understand how to make cross domain request using JSONP Extra of jsonp related issues How much time you will use for reading this article?40 minutes for reading and 1 hour for practice. Jeff is creating a online phone bookJeff is a software engineer who loves his community,he notice that so many new immigrates don’t know how to contact proper social worker or organization to get help.Therefore,he intend to create a online phone book which contains such phone number via api.He is evaluating his requirement and technology to do this. Whether I should use jsonp? Communication technique decision Cross domain request in client side need jsonpThe AJAX(XMLHttpRequest) don’t allow cross domain request(same origin policy).Therefore,we use jsonp to undergo cross domain request(allow cross domain request)For example,the contact numbers which comes from different domain from different organization so jsonp need to be used.And Jeff knows that he is going to use jsonp but he need to know what is jsonp in order to implement it correctly. What is jsonp?JSONP mechanismFor the 1&lt;script src=&quot;url&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; The browser will download the javascript file based on url no matter the url is same domain or cross domain.Then the browser will evaluate(run) the javascript file. 123456789&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/blog_accessary/jsonp/basic/remote.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Example fileIt is the fundamental property of browser which utilized by jsonp. Moreover,the javascript can create the load the script to be loaded dynamically like 123456789101112131415&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script&gt; var url = \"/blog_accessary/jsonp/advanced/remote.js\"; var script = document.createElement('script'); script.setAttribute('src', url); document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Example file Jsonp componentThe jsonp file will contain the message(usually in json format but not necessary) with a wrapper function (which defined in local file).For example: 1wrapper(&#123;&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Police&quot;, &quot;Id&quot;: 1, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: 67221234&#125;); After the loading this jsonp file using the script,when the browser evaluate the jsonp file,the jsonp file call the wrapper function,therefore the remote data of jsonp is passed to local file(due to the function is defined in local file). Now Jeff knows what is jsonp now,he is going the build his online phone book now. How to make cross domain request using jsonp?Here are three jsonp fileHospital: 1jsonPFileLoadedHandler(&#123;&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Hospital&quot;, &quot;Id&quot;: 1, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: 63221234&#125;); Police: 1jsonPFileLoadedHandler(&#123;&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Police&quot;, &quot;Id&quot;: 2, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: 67221434&#125;); Library: 1jsonPFileLoadedHandler(&#123;&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Id&quot;: 3, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: 67221224&#125;); Local: 1234567891011121314151617181920&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script src=\"//blog_accessary/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; var jsonPFileLoadedHandler = function (data) &#123; console.log(data); $(\"#phones\").append(\"&lt;li&gt;\" +data.Id+\" . \" +data.Name + \"(\"+data.PhoneNumber+ \")&lt;/li&gt;\"); &#125;; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;ul id=\"phones\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;first&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/blog_accessary/jsonp/community/hospital.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/blog_accessary/jsonp/community/police.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/blog_accessary/jsonp/community/library.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Result: Example As we can see that the wrapper function is not important(the important thing is the transmission of data and the evaluation(calling process)),therefore,In official jsonp format,the wrapper function name is defined in the url,for example 1/blog_accessary/jsonp/community/hospital.js?callback=jsonPFileLoadedHandler Then the server side will change to proper wrapper according to the callback name. MetaphoreIn jsonp just like government department sending a US-Citizens(jsonp provider) with department name(wrapper function) and the people will write their opinion(message in wrapper function).The government will wait and receive until the citizen finish writing their opinion.

How draftjs-wysiswyg manage their styleStyle in draftjs-wysiswygFor example,it have predefined style rules that map 1 css rule Style CSS style(color) color-rgb(255,255,255) rgb(255,255,255) color-rgb(200,200,200) rgb(200,200,200) Style CSS style(background-color) bgcolor-rgb(255,255,255) rgb(255,255,255) bgcolor-rgb(200,200,200) rgb(200,200,200) draftjs-utils(a library that manage the style in draftjs-wysiswyg)As you can see that a style(like color) have a similiar pattern(we call it a style group). If we use the draftjs-utils toggle custom inline style(color)(e.g rgb(200,200,200)). Possible situation: If current already have color-rgb(255,255,255)color style group .It will remove existing rule and replace with new current style (no more color-rgb(255,255,255) and all is rgb(200,200,200)). If it is already rgb(200,200,200),it will become no color style. html to draftjs(draft-wysiswyg only because it read the html character css style and turn it to own style)The css style color above is the best example How we combine all these components and build own multi-text box editor? Create a group of texts components. When db click texts components,we convert them to draftjs-editor using html-to-draft js pluin. When we done editing,we convert them back to html(using draftjs-to-html) Possible limitation You want to defined your own style group.Them you can build your own draft js with custom predefined stylemap and develop your own draftjs-utils and html to draftj.s","categories":[{"name":"Web前端","slug":"Web前端","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/categories/Web前端/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"深入浅出的写作样本","slug":"writing/how-to-write-headfirst-sample","date":"2018-04-28T08:09:02.000Z","updated":"2018-04-28T12:40:44.323Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/28/writing/how-to-write-headfirst-sample.html","link":"","permalink":"http://jeff-chung.com/2018/04/28/writing/how-to-write-headfirst-sample.html","excerpt":"","text":"Before Reading(Before Reading) What you can learn after reading this article?Understand basic sample How much time you will use for reading this article?10 minutes Jeff learn how to write quickly and efficiently(Introduction)Jeff is a programmer who want some improvement,he heard about that writing can help him learn more quickly and efficiently and good for his reputation.
